## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. 

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* unwarpped the example from \dontrun, and made the example executable in <5 sec.
  
## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* converted the arXiv link to the proper format.

* use \dontrun{} command to skip the check for the example. Since it involves the high dimensional problem, >5s computation time is necessary.

And there is a note about:

Possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  DDL (3:31)
  Debiased (3:15, 10:138)
  confounders (10:114)

I checked these words, and they are accurate for academic purpose.
