Description: This code is based on the paper: 
"Doubly Debiased Lasso: High-Dimensional Inference under Hidden Confounding" 
by Zijian Guo, Domagoj Cevid, and Peter Buhlmann. The functions included allow
the creation of a basic dataset for simulations, an estimator of betahat using
spectral transformations and a projection vector, a confidence interval for the
estimator, and a computation of bias in the estimator.
